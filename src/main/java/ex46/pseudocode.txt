The goal is to read in a text file that contains words, count how many of each word there are, and display that using asterisks.

The program takes in the text file as a List of String's.
That List of String's is then converted into another List of String's that are each individual word.

The 2nd List of String's is then put into a for loop where it is converted into an ArrayList of Word objects:
///
for each element in the 2nd list of strings
{
    if the current element is already in the ArrayList of Word's
    {
        add to that Word object's amounts
    }
}

if the word is unique
{
    add it to the ArrayList of Word objects
}
///

A for loop then happens for each element of the ArrayList of Word objects
    It prints out the word
    Another for loop is here to count how many asterisks need to be printed.
        An Asterisk is printed

The program ends.
