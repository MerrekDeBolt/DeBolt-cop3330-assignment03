The goal is to read in a text file, then parse it, then display it as a table.

The program reads in the text file as a List of String's.

The List of String's is then parsed with substrings and indexOf functions like so:
///
records[index].LastName = line.substring(startOfSubstring, whereCommaIs);
records[index].FirstName = line.substring(startOfSubstring, whereCommaIs);
records[index].Salary = line.substring(startOfSubstring, endOfLine);
///

The array of Record's is now formatted and displayed as a table.

The program ends.
