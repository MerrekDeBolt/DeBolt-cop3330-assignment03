The goal is to read in a JSON file that contains an array of objects under the name "products", then allow the user to input which item they are looking for to return data.

The program reads in the JSON file as an Item class.
This Item class contains an array of Products called "products".
The Products class contains a Name string, a price double, and a quantity int.

The program then goes into a while loop that exits only when an item is found.
After every user input it checks the array "products" inside of "item" to see if the input matches any of "item.products[x].name"
    If it does, the item is considered found and the index is set to "item.CurrentIndex" to use later to recall data.

Once an item is found it's name, price, and quantity will be printed.

The program ends.
