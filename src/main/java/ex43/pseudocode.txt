The goal is to make a website folder and files, taking input from the user for the site name, author, and whether or not to make JavaScript and CSS folders.

The program takes input from the user for siteName, author, and two booleans that are named javaScript and CSS.

A Website object is made that stores the first 2 string variables and converts the last 2 strings into booleans.

Directories and files are then made for:
the root of the website
the index.html
the js folder
the css folder

The index.html file is written with
///
<html>
    <head>
        <title>#SITENAME#</title>
        <meta name="author" content="#AUTHOR#"></meta>
    </head>
</html>
///

The program ends.
